<h2> Introduction </h2>
<h3> Why Learn Linear Algebra? </h3>
This write up is an overview of some of the linear algebra fundamentals. It focuses on providing an intuitive/geometric review of some of the main concepts. The coverage is by no means comprehensive or complete. It's meant to serve as review material for those who haven't touched it in a very long time, or as a brief intro for those who want an over-the-top view of the landscape.

<blockquote>Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear functions </blockquote>

Functions are computations/transformations taht take a set of inputs and produce an output. Functions of several variables are often presented in one line such as:

$$
f(x,y) = 3x + 5y
$$ 

In mathematics, the concept of linearity plays a very important role. Mathematically, a linear function, or linear map, or linear operator, $f$ is a function that satisfies:

1. $f(x,y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for any input $x$ and $y$
2. $f(cx) = cf(x)$ for any input $x$ and any scalar $c$

Put into words, the first condition means that the output of a function acting on a sum of inputs is just equal to the sum of the individual outputs. The second implies that the output of a scaled input is just the scaled output of the original input. 

Linear functions are those whose graph is a straight line. A linear function has the following form:

$$
y = f(x) = a+bx
$$

Here, $x$ is our independent variable and $y$ is our dependent variable (since the result $y$ depends on the transformation we perform on $x$).

Notice that although we classify one variable as being dependent on the other, in reality, both variables are linked and dependent on each other. We simply choose to classify the variable which takes an input as the 'independent' one. In our example above, we can just as easily choose to exchange our variables and make $y$ the independent variable and $x$ the dependent one. 

Let's take $y = f(x) = 3x+1$ as an example. We can choose to model the above function in terms of $y$ by taking the inverse, so we get:
$$
y = 3x+1
y-1 = 3x
x = f(y) = y/3 - 1/3
$$ 

In either case, you get the point. Our linear function can be viewed as representing a linear relationship between two or more variables. The relationship between these variables are the relationships we model in linear algebra.

To make things easier to grasp, we usually represent our variable relationship visually by projecting input variable $x$ on a horizontal axis (which we call the $x$-axis) and showing its mapping to variable $y$ on a vertical axis (which we call the $y$-axis). This lets us get a visual intuition of how our function works in transforming inputs to outputs, and lets us model our linear transformations geometrically.

Of course, linear functions aren't the only types of functions. Non-linear functions don't have a linear mapping and are not represented by straight lines. Some examples of non-linear functions are provided below:

<h2> Vectors </h2>
The key starting point of linear algebra is the concept of vectors. In high school physics, chances are you've already seen that concept as being nothing more than "a number and a direction". This isn't false, but it's definitely not the whole story. It's rather intuitive way of introducing vectors, hence why we'll use this analogy extensively.

From a mathematical perspective, vectors are just a way of stacking numbers together in a column or a row. For example, 
$$ 
\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} i \\ 3 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 2.1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} -3 & \frac{1}{2} & 4 \end{bmatrix}
$$

The first two vector examples are naturally referred to as column vectors and the last two as row vectors. 

The amount of numbers is referred to as the dimension of the vector. Even if you've never explicitly learned about vectors until now, you've already seen them. A 2-dimensional vector of real numbers is analogous to the Cartesian coordinates. For example, a 2-dimensional vector looks like:

A 3-dimensional vector of real numbers is analogous to the spatial coordinates in three dimensions. You can always think of a vector with $n$ numbers as a point in $n$-dimensional "hyperspace".

For simplicity, we'll generally use 2 and 3 dimensional vectors from now on, but everything we explain below applies to vectors of arbitrary sizes.

<h3> Vector Addition </h3>
Since we just defined a new mathematical concept, it's natural to ask the question: can we add and multiply vectors?

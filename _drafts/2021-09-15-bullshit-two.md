<h2> Hilbert Space </h2>
<span class="blue"> The Euclidean space we consider in everyday life is mathematically called the Hilbert Space. </span> Any general metric graph is a Hilbert Space. Any $n$ dimensional Hilbert space is sand to be in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which indicates that all the numbers represented in this space are real. 

Note that <span class="red"> Cartesian space is different from Hilbert space </span> and is a subset of it. Mathematically, a Hilbert space is an abstract vector space which preserves the structure of an inner product. In non-math terms, it just means that <u> one can measure length and angle in this space </u>.

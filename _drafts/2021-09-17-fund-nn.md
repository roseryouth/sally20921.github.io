<h2> Introduction </h2>
The core concepts of neural networks are important but it is extremely easy to forget the fundamentals when you are swimming in the sea of modern state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. This blog post will be a reminder to those who haven't touched a deep learning textbook in a while but it will cover in great depth the advanced mathematics and details behind neural networks. You might think you know all about neural networks, but you are wrong!

<h3> Perceptrons </h3>

Okay, so let's start with the basics, the <b> perceptrons </b> . Perceptrons are a type of artificial neuron-the main neuron model commonly used is called by the name <u> sigmoid neuron </u>. We'll get to sigmoid neurons shortly. But before that, it is worth taking time to first remind ourselves what perceptrons were. 

A perceptron takes several binary inputs $x_1, x_2, \dots$ and produces a single binary output.

# Research Projects 

### Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Mobile/Edge Devices (05/2020 - present)  
This project aims to develop an unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm that improves the state-of-the-art algorithm. 

### Development of a Key Value Store that supports LevelDB API for Key Value SSDs (09/2019 - 05/2020)
This project aims to design a LevelDB-like key-value store that supports range queries, snapshots, etc. for KV SSDs. By replacing block SSD with KV SSD and designing a software layer to provide more operations mentioned above, this project achieves significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art LSM-tree based key-value store such as LevelDB. Here is a slide that describes the characteristics of KVSSD: [link](https://www.systor.org/2019/slides/S8P1%20Towards%20Building%20a%20High-performance,%20Scale-in%20Key-value%20Storage%20System.pdf)

### Building A Multi-Behavior Recommendation System Using Attention Mechanism, Data Mining Laboratory (01/2020 - 02/2020)
Given user behavior data of multiple types, this project aims to predict users' next behaviors of target type. An algorithm was created that captures the sequential patterns by using multihead attention mechanism. This algorithm improves the previous algorithm that was designed by using RNN (recurrent neural networks). Here is a paper about Recommendation System that was originally designed with RNN : [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06939.pdf)

    "title": "Homogeneous Coordinates and Projective Geometry",
    "body": "2021/08/31 - Introduction: In this article, I’m going to explain homogeneous coordinates (a. k. a 4D coordinates) as simply as I can. It is now time to take a closer look at projective geometry. Terminology: Most of the time when working with 3D, we are thinking in terms of Euclidean geometry-that is, coordinates in three-dimensional space ($X$, $Y$ and $Z$). However, there are certain situations where it is useful to think in terms of projective geometry instead. Projective geometry has an extra dimension, called $W$, in addition to the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ dimensions. This four-dimensional space is called projective space and coordinates in projective space are called homogenous coordinates. For the purposes of 3D software, the terms projective and homogeous are basically interchangeable with 4D. Not Quaternions: Quaternions look a lot like homogeneous coordinates. Both are 4D vectors, commonly depicted as $(X,Y,Z,W)$. However, quaternions and homogeneous coordinates are different concepts, with different uses. An Analogy in 2D: First, let’s look at how projective geometry works in 2D, before we move on to 3D.  Imagine a projector that is projecting a 2D image onto a screen. It’s easy to identify the $X$ and $Y$ dimensions of the projected image.  Now, if you step back from the 2D image and look at the projector and the screen, you can see the $W$ dimension, too. The $W$ dimension is the distance from the projector to the screen.  So what does the $W$ dimension do, exactly? Imagine what would happen to the 2D image if you increased or decreased $W$-that is, if you increased or decreased the distance between the projector and the screen. If you move the projector closer to the screen, the whole 2D image becomes smaller. If you move the projector away from the screen, the 2D image becomes larger. As you can see, the value of $W$ affects the size (a. k. a scale) of the image. Applying it to 3D: There is no such thing as a 3D projector (yet), so its’ harder to imagine projective geometry in 3D, but the $W$ value works exactly the same as it does in 2D. When $W$ increases, the coordinates expands (scales up). When $W$ decreases, the coordinates shrinks (scales down). The $W$ is basically a scaling transformation for the 3D coordinates. When $W = 1$: The usual advice for 3D programming beginners is to always set $W=1$ whenever converting a 3D coordinate to 4D coordinate. The reason for that is that when you scale a coordinate by a 1 it doesn’t shrink or grow, it just stays the same size. So, when $W=1$, it has no effect on the $X$, $Y$, or $Z$ values. For this reason, when it comes to 3D computer graphics, coordinates are said to be correct only when $W=1$. If you tried to render with $W=0$ your program would crash when it attempted to divide by zero. With $W&lt;0$ everything would flip unside-down and back-to-front. Mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as an incorrect homogeneous coordinate. Using coordinates with $W=1$ is just a useful convention for the 3D computer grahics. The Math: Now, let’s look at some actual numbers, to see how the math works.  Let’s say that the projector is $3$ meters away from the screen, and there is a dot on the 2D image at the coordinate $(15, 21)$. This gives us the projective coordinate vector $(X,Y,W) = (15,21,3)$.  Now imagine that the projector was pushed closer to the screen so that the distance was $1$ meter. The closer the project gets to the screen, the smaller the image becomes. The projector has moved three times closer, so the image becomes three times smaller. If we take the original coordinate vector and divide all the values by three, we get the new vector where $W=1$:  $$(\frac{15}{3}, \frac{21}{3}, \frac{3}{3}) = (5,7,1)$$. The dot is now at coordinate $(5,7)$. This is how an incorrect homogeneous coordinate is converted to a correct coordinate: divide all the values by $W$. The process is exactly the same for 2D and 3D coordinates. Dividing all the values in a vector is done by a scalar multiplication with the reciprocal of the divisor. Here is a 4D example:  $$\frac{1}{5}(10, 20, 30, 5) = (\frac{10}{5}, \frac{20}{5}, \frac{30}{5}, \frac{5}{5}) = (2,4,6,1)$$ Uses of Homogeneous Coordinates in Computer Graphics: As mentioned earlier, in regard to 3D computer graphics, homogeneous coordinates are useful in certain situations. We will look at some of those situations here. Translation Matrices for 3D Coordinates:  A four-column matrix can only be multiplied with a four-element vector, which is why we often use homogeneous 4D vectors instead of 3D vectors. Rotation and scaling transformation matrices only require three columns. But, in order to do translation, the matrices need to have at least four columns. This is why transformations are often $4 \times 4$ matices. However, a matrix with four columns cannot be multiplied by a 3D vector, due to the rules of matrix multiplication. A four-column matrix can only be mulitplied with a four-element vector, which is why we often use homogeneous 4D vectors instead of 3D vectors. The 4th dimension $W$ is usually unchanged, when using homogeneous coordinates in matrix transformation. $W$ is set to $1$ when converting 3D coordinates into 4D, and is usually still $1$ after the transformation matrices are applied, at which point it can be converted back into a 3D coordinate by ignoring $W$. This is true for all translation, rotation, and scaling transformations, which by far are the most common types of transformations. The notable exception is projection matrices, which do affect the $W$ dimension. Perspective Transformation: In 3D, perspective is the phenomenon where an object appears smaller the further away it is from the camera. A far-away mountain can appear to be smaller than a cat, if the cat is close enough to the camera. Perspective is implemented in 3D computer graphics by using a transformation matrix that changes the $W$ element of each vertex. After the camera matrix is applied to each vertex, but before the projection matrix is applied, the $Z$ element of each vertex represents the distance away from the camera. Therefore, the larger $Z$ is, the more the vertex should be scaled down. The $W$ dimension affects the scale, so the projection matrix just changes the $W$ based on the $Z$ value. Here is an example of a perspective projection matrix being applied to a homogeneous coordinate:  $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp; \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$ Notice how the $W$ value is changed to $4$, which comes from the $Z$ value. After the perspective projection matrix is applied, each vertex undergoes perspective division. Perspective division is just a specific term for converting the homogeneous coordinate back to $W=1$, as explained earlier in the article. Continuing with the example above, the perspective division step would look like this:  $$\frac{1}{4}(2,3,4,4) = (0. 5,0. 75, 1,1)$$ After perspective division, the $W$ value is discarded, and we are left with a 3D coordinate that has been correctly scaled according to a 3D perspective projection. Positioning Directional Lights: One property of homogeneous coordinates is that they allow you to have points at infinity (infinite length vectors), which is not possible with 3D coordinates. Points at infinity occur when $W=0$. If you try to convert a $W=0$ homogeneous coordinate into a normal $W=1$ coordinate, it results in a bunch of divide-by-zero operations:  $$ \frac{1}{0}(2,3,4,0) = (\frac{2}{0}, \frac{3}{0}, \frac{4}{0}, \frac{0}{0})$$. This means that homogeneous coordinates with $W=0$ can not be converted back into 3D coordinates. What use does this have? Well, directional lights can be thought of as point lights that are infinitely far away. When a point light is infinitely far away, the rays of light become parallel, and all of the light travels in a single direction. This is basically the definition of a directional light. So, traditionally, in 3D graphics, directional lights are differentiated from point lights by the value of $W$ in the position vector of the light. If $W=1$, then it is a point light. If $W=0$, then it is a directional light. This is more of a traditional convention, rather than a useful way to write lighting code. Directional lights and point lights are usually implemented with separate code, because they behave differently. Summary: Homogeneous coordinates have an extra dimension called $W$, which scales the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ dimensions. Matrices for translation and perspective projection can only be applied to homogeneous coordinates, which is why they are so common in 3D computer graphics. The $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ values are said to be correct when $W=1$. Any homogeneous coordinates can be converted to have $W=1$ by dividing all four dimensions by the $W$ value, except if $W=0$. When $W=0$, the coordinate represents a point at infinity (a vector with infinite length), and this is often used to denote the direction of directional lights. "

    "body": "2019/01/27 - The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. "

    "body": "2019/01/24 - There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "

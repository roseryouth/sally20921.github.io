\section{Introduction: Camera Decomposition}
The camera matrix by itself is useful for projecting 3D points into 2D, but it has several drawbacks.
\begin{itemize}
\item It doesn't tell you about the camera pose.
\item It does not tell you about the camera's internal geometry.
\end{itemize}

To address these drawbacks, a camera matrix can be decomposed into the product of two matrices: an intrinsic matrix, $K$ and an extrinsic matrix $[R|-RC]$.

\begin{equation}
P = K[R|-RC]
\end{equation}

The matrix $K$ is a $3 \times 3$ upper-triangular matrix that describes the camera's internal parameters like focal length. $R$ is a $3 \times 3$ r

#  Decorators 
- In Python, a decorator is code that  can alter a callable. Closures enable the creation of decorators. 
- Normally the callables that are decorated in Python are either functions or methods. 
- The *verbose* decorator actually has an issue. It only works with  functions that do not have parameters. 



```python
tensorboard  --logdir ~/ch3_tb_log --port 6006
```

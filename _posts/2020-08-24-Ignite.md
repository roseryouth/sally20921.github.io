* `ignite` is a high-level library to help with training and evaluating neural networks in PyTorch flexibly and tansparently.
* Features
 * Less code than pure PyTorch while ensuring  maximum control and simplicity
 * Extensible API for metrics, experiment managers, and other components
 
 

 
```python
from ignite.engine import Events, create_supervised_trainer, create_supervised_evaluator
from ignite.metrics import Accuracy, Loss

model = Net()
train_loader, val_loader = get_data_loaders(train_batch_size, val_batch_size)
optimizer =  torch.optim.SGD(model
 ```

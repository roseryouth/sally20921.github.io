excerpt: 
---

* `ignite` is a high-level library to help with training and evaluating neural networks in PyTorch flexibly and tansparently.
* Features
 * Less code than pure PyTorch while ensuring  maximum control and simplicity
 * Extensible API for metrics, experiment managers, and other components
 
* Object `trainer` and `evaluator` are instances of `Engine` - main component of Ignite. `Engine` is an abstraction over your training/validation loop.
* In general, we can define `trainer` and `evaluator` using directly `Engine` class and custom training/validation step logic:
 
```python
metrics = {
 'accuracy': Accuracy(),
 'nll': Loss(loss)
 ```
* We  define two metrics: *accuracy* and *loss* to compute on validation dataset.  
# Engine 
* The essence of the framework is the class `Engine`, an abstraction that  loops a given number  of times over provided data, executes a processing function and returns a result:
```
while epoch < max_epochs:
 #run an epoch on data
 data_iter = iter(data)
 
```

# Metrics 
* Library provides a list of out-of-the-box metrics for various Machine Learning tasks. Two ways of computing metrics are supported: 1) online and 2) storing the entire output history

```python
from ignite.metrics import Accuracy
```

# Preface 
* Arrays are the basis of data science because they ahve structures of vectors and matrices that  give the meaning  of direction and magnitude to each value in the dataset. The matrix structure allows transformation  to a simple form  without losing the basic characteristics  of a vast data set. These transformations are  useful for efficient processing of data and for  finding implicit characteristics.  
* Linear Algebra, a field that provides a basic theory of vectors and matrices, provides many algorithms to increase the  accuracy and speed of computation  for analyzing data and to discover the  characteristics of a dataset. These algorithms  are  very useful for understanding the computing  process of probability, statistics and the learning machine.

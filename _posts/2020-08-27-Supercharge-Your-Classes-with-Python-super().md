# An Overview of Python's *super()* Function
- At a high level, *super()* gives you access to methods in a superclass from the subclass that inherits from  it.
- *super()* alone returns a temporary object that then allows you to call that superclass's method. 
- Why would you want to  do any of this? A common use case is building classes that extend teh functionality of previously built classes. 
- calling the previously built methods with *super()* saves you from needing to rewrite those methods in your subclass, and allows you  to  swap  out superclasses with  minimal code changes. 

# What can *super()* do for you?





```python
tensorboard  --logdir ~/ch3_tb_log --port 6006

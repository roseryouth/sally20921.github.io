# A brief overview of Tensorboard
- TensorBoard is a web-based application that can help you visualize the  metrics, parameters, and structure
of a deep neural network created in TensorFlow. It  will help you debug and optimize your deep neural networks faster and easier.
- TensorBoard will allow you to monitor the changes in metrics and parameters as your network is trained, 
which can greatly accelearte troubleshooting.
```python
with open('my-new-file.txt','r') as f:
  lines  = file.readlines()
  for line in lines:
    print(line, end='')
 ```

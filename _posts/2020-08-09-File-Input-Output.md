# Introduction to Files, Paths, and IO
* A common format used in Unix/Linux and Windows systems is the ASCII text format. The ASCII format is a set  of codes that represent various characters that is widely used by  operating  systems. 
* ASCII is a very  useful format to use for text files as they can be  read by  a wide  range of  editors and browsers. However, programming languages such as  Python often  use a different set of character encodings such  as a  Unicode character encodeing (such as  UTF-8). Unicode is another standard representing  characters using various codes. 
* It can be necessary to translate ASCII into Unicode (e.g. UTF-8) and vice versa when reading and writing ASCII files in Python.

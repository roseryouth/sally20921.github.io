* The easiest way to use Fire is to take any Python program, and then simply call `fire.Fire()' at the end of the  program. This will expose the full contents of the program to the command line.

 
 

 
```python
from ignite.engine import Events, create_supervised_trainer, create_supervised_evaluator
from ignite.metrics import Accuracy, Loss

model = Net()
train_loader, val_loader = get_data_loaders(train_batch_size, val_batch_size)
optimizer =  torch.optim.SGD(model
 ```

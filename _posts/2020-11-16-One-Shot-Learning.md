# Introduction to One-shot Learning
* The primary motivation behind this book is to train a model with very few examples that is capable of generalizing to unfamiliar categories without extensive retraining.
* One-shot learning is an object categorization problem in computer vision. 
* While most ML-based object categorization algorithms require hundreds or thousands of images and very large datasets to train on, one-shot learning aims to learn information about object categories from one, or only a few, training images.

# One-shot learning - overview
* One-shot learning can be seen as an approach to train machines in a way that is similar to how humans learn.
* One-shot learning is an approach to learn a new task using limited supervised data with the help of strong prior knowledge.

# Prerequisites of one-shot learning 
* If we look into further discussion about how we can learn necessary information from a limited amount of data, we will realize that the human brain already has neurons trained to extract important information.
* For any form of one-shot learning, we can say we need at least one of the following things:
 * Previously trained filters and a pre-determined architecture
 * A correct assumption of data distribution
 * A defined form of taxonomy for information stored or collected

* In certain cases, we observe that we can only have a very low level of feature extraction.
